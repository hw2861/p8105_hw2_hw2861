##### Question1

In the first step, i import and clean the NYC_Transit_data.

``` r
NYC_Transit =read_csv("./hw2_downloaddata/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor:: clean_names() %>% 
  select(line,station_name,station_latitude,station_longitude,route1:route11,entry,vending,entrance_type,ada) %>%
  mutate(entry=recode(entry, "YES"=TRUE , "NO" = FALSE))
```

The dataset contains information about each entrance and exit for each
subway station in NYC. In the original dataset, there were 32 variables
on subway stations. I cleaned the dataset by retaining my variables of
interests.A part of the variable on geographical location has been
removed. In the new dataset, It contains the variables as subway lines,
station name, the latitude and longitude of the station,routes
served,entry, vending,entrance type, and ADA compliance. In the
meantime, I standardised the names of the remaining 19 variables. And
the data of the entry variable has been recoded from a character(YES vs
NO) to a logical variable with “TRUE” or “FALSE”. For the dimension,
There are **1868 **rows × **19 **columns in the resulting dataset. These
data are **NOT tidy **currently. Because there are redundant columns for
route numbers.And the route numbers across 11 columns can be organised
into 1 columns.

\##Further 3 question in Q1 How many distinct stations are there?

There are **465** distinct stations

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
NYC_Transit_AD = filter(NYC_Transit,ada==TRUE)
NYC_Transit_AD_number = nrow(distinct(NYC_Transit_AD, line, station_name))
```

**84** stations are ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
NYC_Transit_vending = filter(NYC_Transit,vending == "NO",entry == TRUE)
NYC_Transit_Vending2 = filter(NYC_Transit,vending == "NO")
vending = {nrow(NYC_Transit_vending)}/{nrow(NYC_Transit_Vending2)}
```

**0.3770492** of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance.

\##Further question in Q1 As question 1 was not scored and the answer
was given. The standard answers have been **directly pasted** here in
the next chunk.

``` r
NYC_Transit_A=
  NYC_Transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct

NYC_Transit_A_ada=
  NYC_Transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

How many distinct stations serve the A train? There are **60** serve the
A train.

Of the stations that serve the A train, There are **17** are ADA
compliant.
